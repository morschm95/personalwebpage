<p id='about-me'>
	I am a Computer Engineering student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I have always been interested in engineering,
	and after taking four years of engineering classes in high school (through Project Lead the Way), I knew that was the career
	for me. I am seeking to gain experience to augment my studies during my undergraduate years.
