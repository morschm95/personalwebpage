	I worked at hc1.com as a Software Development intern. I utilized various Amazon Web Services tools to analyze user metrics data collected. I used Firehose to transfer the data from the application to an s3 bucket for storage. Following this, Elastic MapReduce was utilized to help analyze the data with Apache Spark and Apache Hive. Athena and QuickSight were then applied to visualize the data.
