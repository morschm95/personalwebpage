	I worked with another student to implement an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) on the Pynq-Z1 board. We took an input from a composite video source (GoPro) and sampled it at 1 MSPS (million samples per second). After collecting the data, we used a Python program to convert it to a grayscale digital image. We had to create both the hardware (using Vivado software) and software (using Python) to complete this project. View our final report by clicking the title.

		A group of 3 created an Android App for clubs at Rose-Hulman. We used NodeJS and created a SQL Server database. We integrated RoseFire to allow Rose-Hulman students to log into the app with their Rose-Hulman credentials. We utilized tables, views, stored procedures, triggers, and indexes on the database to accomplish all desired functionality and to improve the database speed.

	Six students from Rose-Hulman worked with 5 students from Gannon University and 19 students from Uppsala University in Sweden to revolutionize the Swedish healthcare system. The goal of the project was to create the Utopian Swedish healthcare system in the year 2025. We learned to work with students remotely and in different time-zones.

During the Winter Quarter of my Sophomore year at Rose-Hulman, a group of two of us were tasked with using the C programming language and the PIC Microcontroller (from Microchip http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC16F18875) to create a project. For our project, our aim was to use lasers in some way. After brainstorming ideas, we decided to make a laser-based instrument. Five lasers shine onto five different phototransistors and act like strings, so that disrupting a beam causes a tone to be played from a speaker. There are five different speakers and five different lasers. Each of the five combinations of a laser, phototransistor, and speaker act independently, so multiple notes can be played at the same time. View our final report by clicking the title.
